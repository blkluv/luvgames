Considering over 50 million adults in the U.S. alone suffer from some form of arthritis, it is a very widespread issue that currently lacks a cure. In fact, of Americans over 65, nearly 50% have the disease. Arthritis is often overshadowed by other diseases with arthritis research only getting $312 million dollars by the CDC in 2021. To increase funding and to show support for the tens of millions of people suffering from arthritis, advocacy efforts are essential. The following post contains overviews relating to three notable and credible organizations leading the fight against arthritis.
[Arthritis foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/)

-   This organization works to create a unified community to fight arthritis by funding research, forming support groups, advocating for important legislation, providing resources, and establishing community connections. This organization has seen great success, even raising over $500 million for arthritis research.
    
-   To learn more about the inner working of and opportunities available at this organization, go to the advocacy section of the DiscussMed website.
    

[Arthritis Council](https://chronicdisease.org/page/ArthritisAboutUs/)

-   The Arthritis Council serves as a place for leaders of arthritis advocacy to join together and share their knowledge and wisdom to help further defeat arthritis. These leaders in arthritis advocacy range from managers of arthritis-fighting organizations to staff of arthritis programs. The hope is that by sharing what works and what does not work, programs can avoid the pitfalls of others and work together to create the most effective programs possible.
    

[Osteoarthritis Action Alliance](https://oaaction.unc.edu/)

-   The Osteoarthritis Action Alliance functions a bit differently than most other organizations in that it is actually a conglomerate of organizations. This Alliance works to advocate against osteoarthritis and reduce the suffering those who have it must bear. The OAA pushes organizations to work together to collectively raise awareness and share each other’s resources in the hope of improving each other’s organizations and demonstrating solidarity to get one step closer to eliminating osteoarthritis.
