In the fight against breast cancer, fundraising is key. The funds raised go to ground-breaking research, fight-changing advocacy efforts, and life-saving resources. Some notable fundraisers include:

-   [Making Strides Against Breast Cancer](https://www.cancer.org/involved/fundraise/making-strides-against-breast-cancer.html)
    

A fundraiser run by the American Cancer Society, Making Strides Against Breast Cancer is the largest network of breast cancer events in the U.S. Proceeds go to funding research, resources and screenings, and the event is meant to show the commitment of communities, companies, and individuals to fighting and defeating breast cancer. To participate in this event, you can set up a digital fundraising page and network with friends and family to raise money. Then, you can find a Making Strides event near you, and participate in a walk and festivities all to show support and solidarity in the fight against breast cancer.

A fundraiser hosted by the National Breast Cancer Foundation, Game Pink brings together gamers, streamers, developers, and publishers in the fight. All funds are used to support screening, education, care, and support. To get involved, set up a charity stream of yourself playing your favorite game, or support a another charity stream, devoted to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.
