It is imperative to catch breast cancer early to ensure one has the best chance of survival. It is much more manageable if it is caught, before it spreads beyond the local region it forms. Therefore, it is essential to be able to recognize the common symptoms and signs associated with breast cancer. Here are some of the main symptoms and signs:

-   Lump in the breast
    
-   Bloody discharge from the nipple
    
-   Swelling of the breast
    
-   Pain in the nipple area
    
-   Swollen lymph nodes under the arm
    

It is important to note that women are at a much higher risk of developing breast cancer than men. In fact, 1 in 8 women will have breast cancer in their lifetime, while 1 in 833 men will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. The greater risk women face is due to them having more breast cells and those very cells constantly being exposed to growth promoting factors. For women, their risk of breast cancer doubles if they have a first-degree family member (parent or full sibling) with it.

Breast cancer accounts for a sizable portion of all cancer diagnoses with it making up 12% of new cases globally. This figure means that many people have to fight breast cancer, but sadly, even with recent advancements, 1 in 39 women still die from it. Therefore, it is important to recognize the symptoms and signs of breast cancer very early on.
