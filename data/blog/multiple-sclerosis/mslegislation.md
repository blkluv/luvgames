In this blog, we will review some important legislation passed in the United States that have helped advance the fight against multiple sclerosis. By reviewing this legislation, we hope for you to see the importance of advocating and lobbying for multiple sclerosis related legislation. Some legislation passed relating to multiple sclerosis includes:

Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Act of 1997

Provides Medicare coverage for FDA approved drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis. In other words, this piece of legislation made essential medications and treatments more affordable and available to all which is essential in a disease like MS where the damage to nerves progressively gets worse, so by intervening earlier, the damage can be mitigated.

Stop the Wait Act of 2022

This bill has not yet passed. It intends to reduce the mandatory waiting periods for those with disabilities to get disability checks and health coverage through Medicare. The goal of this bill is to help improve the lives of those with disabilities and ensure they can get help and care quicker. For example, in 2017, over 10,000 Amerians died in this waiting period, so by reducing it, thousands of lives can be saved. This legislation applies to disabilities including multiple sclerosis.

It is important to recognize the impact that passing legislation can have and that legal avenues can help achieve goals that are not possible any other way. Therefore, advocacy is essential.
