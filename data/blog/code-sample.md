Use these if you'd like. Probably won't be used but nice to have here.

## Inline Highlighting

Example of inline highlighting `sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)`

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code to spice up the text

```javascript
let hahz = "Co-founder";
console.log(hahz === "Co-founder"); //returns true!
```
