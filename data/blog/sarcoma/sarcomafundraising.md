The Stand Up to Sarcoma Gala is an annual event hosted by the Sarcoma Foundation of America. The next SFA Gala will be hosted on September 28, 2022 at the Edison Ballroom located in New York City. This event is important as it recognizes leading doctors, researchers, organizations, and advocates in the fight against sarcoma. Additionally, the funds raised by this gala are used for patient education programs, research efforts, and research grants.
