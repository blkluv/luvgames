Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease is also extremely prevalent around the world with 18 million people dying globally from it. Therefore, active participation as a means to fight heart disease is necessary. One can get involved in the fight through some notable organizations including:

[American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/)

The American Heart Association (AHA) has been a key fighter against heart disease. Having raised over $4.8 billion in research and reduced deaths from heart disease by 15.1%, AHA is not only a key fighter but a leader. To make the impact that they have achieved, they rely on volunteers, advocates, and donors. The goal of AHA is to save and improve the lives of those suffering from heart disease and stroke. To learn about some advocacy opportunities available through AHA, go to the resource section of discussmed.org.

[World Heart Federation](https://world-heart-federation.org/)

This organization aims to ensure that every person, no matter their gender, race, socioeconomic status, geographic location, etc, has access to the information, care, and treatment necessary to tackle heart disease.

[WomenHeart](https://www.womenheart.org/)

Women often experience different heart attack signs than men and can be affected by heart disease differently. Therefore, this organization aims to be the voice guiding, advocating, and helping women who are at risk for or suffering from heart disease.
