As of 2018, over 30 million adults in the United States were diagnosed with heart disease. Many Americans suffer from heart disease with 25% of all American deaths due to some form of the disease. While heart disease is particularly prevalent in America due to the great obesity and unhealthy diets of many Americans, heart disease is still a very common experience. In fact, each year, around 18 million people die globally due to heart disease with someone dying every 36 seconds, making heart disease the leading cause of death in the world.

Heart disease has a multitude of causes with it being most common in Caucasians. Those at highest risk of developing heart disease are alcoholics, diabetics, and those who are obese. Additionally, out of all the heart diseases, coronary artery disease is the most common.
