Autism is a disorder which alters the development of the brain resulting in difficulty socializing and communicating. Autism contains a broad range of conditions with each being on the “autism spectrum” with some conditions more severe than others. Some of the most common autism spectrum disorders are Asperger’s syndrome (one of the less severe autism spectrum disorders and may result in one being socially awkward or having all-absorbing interests), Rett syndrome (those affected lose function of their hands, speech, and coordination over time), and Kanner’s syndrome (known as Classic Autistic Disorder and results in hypersensitivity to stimuli, lack of eye contact, and difficulty communicating).

Autism spectrum disorders are thought to not be caused by one single factor but rather both environmental and genetic factors. In terms of environmental factors, exposure pollutants and infections during pregnancy increase one’s likelihood of developing autism. In terms of genetics, autism spectrum disorders are often caused by a simple, rare mutation occurring in only one gene. For example, mutations in the ARID1B, ASH1L, and CHD2 genes have been linked with increased likelihood of developing autism.
