[Debbie’s Dream Foundation](https://debbiesdream.org/)

The founder of Debbie’s Dream Foundation faced the harsh and life-altering effects of a stage IV stomach cancer diagnosis. During the intense regimen of chemotherapy, she created Debbie’s Dream Foundation to support research, raise awareness, and provide information regarding gastric cancer. Accordingly, this Foundation has many resources for patients, caregivers, and the general public like a Stomach Cancer 101 which provides basic information needed to be informed about the effects and prevalence of gastric cancer. Additionally, you can get involved in this organization through its many events including conversations about caregiver and patient advocacy and through pushing for its legislative agenda to support the fight against gastric cancer.
