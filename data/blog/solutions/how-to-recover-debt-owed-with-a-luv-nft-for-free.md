LUV NFT created a [Final Notice: Outstanding Debt Settlement](https://vote.luvnft.com) collection as a blockchain blueprint on how to recover outstanding debt. Leading with an example of a VC company that promised to reimburse the LUV NFT co-founder Hassan “Hahz” Terry for his business travels to Madrid, Spain, to discuss a business investment.

# Web2 Debit Collection Problems 

**Non-Payment:** The most obvious issue is non-payment by the debtor, whether it’s an individual or a business. This can occur due to various reasons such as financial hardship, disputes over the debt, or simply unwillingness to pay.

**Communication Issues:** Debtors may avoid or ignore communication attempts from creditors or collection agencies, making it difficult to reach a resolution or negotiate a repayment plan.

**Legal Complexity:** Debt collection involves various legal regulations and procedures, and navigating them can be complex. Creditors and collectors must ensure they follow all applicable laws and regulations to avoid legal repercussions.

**Debt Validation:** Debtors may dispute the validity of the debt, leading to delays in the collection process. Creditors or collectors may need to provide proof of the debt’s validity, which can be time-consuming.

**Harassment:** Unethical or aggressive debt collection practices, such as constant phone calls, threats, or harassment, can lead to legal issues and damage the reputation of the creditor or collection agency.

**Financial Hardship:** Debtors may genuinely be facing financial hardship, making it challenging for them to repay their debts. In such cases, creditors or collectors may need to explore alternative repayment options or negotiate settlements.

**Bankruptcy:** If a debtor files for bankruptcy, it can complicate the debt collection process. Creditors may need to adhere to bankruptcy laws and may not be able to collect the full amount owed.

**Fraudulent Activity:** In some cases, debtors may engage in fraudulent activity to avoid repayment, such as providing false information or transferring assets to evade creditors.

**Statute of Limitations:** There is a statute of limitations on debt collection, which varies depending on the type of debt and jurisdiction. Creditors must be aware of these limitations and take legal action within the specified timeframe.

**Debt Collection Scams:** Debtors may fall victim to debt collection scams, where fraudulent individuals or organizations attempt to collect debts that the debtor does not owe or use unethical tactics to intimidate them into payment.

# Web5 Debit Collection Solutions

Blockchain technology can potentially address several common problems related to debt collection by introducing transparency, immutability, and efficiency into the process.

Here are some ways blockchain could help:

**Transparency:** Blockchain maintains a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. This transparency can help in verifying the authenticity of debt-related documents, agreements, and payment records, reducing disputes between parties.

**Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, can automate debt agreements and enforce payment terms. This automation can streamline the debt collection process and reduce the need for intermediaries.

**Decentralization:** Blockchain operates on a decentralized network, removing the need for a central authority or intermediary to manage debt-related transactions. This decentralization can reduce the risk of manipulation or bias in debt collection processes.

**Immutable Records:** Once recorded on the blockchain, data cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of debt-related records. This immutability can prevent fraud and unauthorized changes to debt agreements or payment histories.

**Faster Settlements:** Blockchain-based transactions can facilitate faster and more efficient settlements between debtors and creditors by eliminating intermediaries and reducing processing times.

**Global Accessibility:** Blockchain technology is borderless and can facilitate cross-border debt collection by providing a secure and transparent platform for international transactions.

**Improved Security:** Blockchain employs cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data, reducing the risk of fraud, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive debt-related information.

Overall, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the debt collection process by enhancing transparency, efficiency, security, and accessibility while reducing costs and disputes associated with traditional debt collection methods.

# Case Study Live Example

To explain how LUV NFT Outstanding Debt Recovery on Blockchain works we created a case study based on the $5,500 owed by VC Savio Management who promised to reimburse Hahz Terry 8 months ago. The amount of interest from the past due reimbursement is simply $5,500 x 8 months past due totalling $44,000 available here

The first LUV NFT case study is live Final Notice: Outstanding Debt Settlement on OpenSea.io on display for anyone to see and to allow anyone seeking an investment from Savio Management to see their credit history on blockchain.

The only way to remove this debt from blockchain is to buy the LUV NFT and make it private or settle the debt by sending the new amount due to the USDT wallet displayed in the description of the LUV NFT for Hahz to burn the token from the existence of blockchain.

Hahz signed an NDA with Savio Management so they thought they didn’t have to reimburse him after months of conversations and numerous emails requesting to be reimbursed. After talking about this matter with others who dealt with this same VC trickery Hahz discovered this is common among VCs in Switzerland and throughout the industry.

Smart contracts are permissible in court as they represent contracts on the blockchain. The original agreement was tokenized as a LUV NFT. If the debt isn’t settled promptly, Hahz will take Savio Management to court in the jurisdiction where their company is registered, using the smart contract as evidence of the debt owed.
