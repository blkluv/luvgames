As a Blockchain nonprofit infusing spiritual and tech, we solve Web2 issues on the spiritual level first. In 2024, we're no longer spending our spiritual energy of currency on reading click-bait fear frequency articles about African American issues backed by statistics no one can validate. 

![Evil](https://tenor.com/view/evil-dontyou-gif-5071039)

The only statistic that we can verify understanding the universal law of belief, when we believe we have a problem we created that problem in our world 100% of the time.

In 2024 we will no longer invest our energy spiritually in reading any more articles or headlines regarding African American problems knowing that when we believe we have a problem we create it in our world. All of those problems that we once believed no longer exist in our Web5 for purpose economy.

$340 billion pledged by companies to support racial equity following George Floyd‚Äôs murder. Four years after George Floyd‚Äôs murder, McKinsey & Co. has found that $340 billion has been publicly announced by companies to support racial equity and justice. The root of all of these pledges being invested back into the root of the source of the problem is why no one is solving anything or no one knowing where all of the money is going because it's not helping the masses severely affected by the racial inequality in America that is profiting from the problems companies are donating to solve.

* 40% of 1,369 Fortune 1000 companies have made public statements about racial justice between May 2020 and October 2022. This means that approximately 548 companies have made pledges toward racial equity. Be the first person to complete the quest of creating the full list [here](https://zealy.io/c/luvnft/questboard/) 

* Companies have pledged a combined $340 billion toward racial equity over that same period.
  
* Since May 2021, pledges have become vaguer, making it harder to track what specific initiatives the money is going toward.

Allegedly used the $52 million in pledges to support its work on a variety of issues, including criminal justice reform, voting rights, and educational equity. The fund also used the money to support its litigation and advocacy efforts, as well as its work to provide legal assistance to individuals and communities who have been impacted by systemic racism.

* In 2021, The Washington Post fact-checked a claim that the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund had used donations to pay for luxury travel and other expenses.
