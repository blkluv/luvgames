There are many signs and symptoms with ALS that will gradually worsen as the disease further progresses. Some of the common signs and symptoms include:

-   Muscle weakness
    
-   Difficulty walking
    
-   Slurred speech
    
-   Difficulty doing normal activities
    
-   Fatigue
    
-   Poor coordination
    

In the United States, around 5,000 people per year are diagnosed with ALS with an estimated over 30,000 people currently living with the disease. Of those diagnosed, the average age is 55. After diagnosis, there is a 2-5 year life expectancy with the state of living constantly worsening. While not many people are diagnosed with ALS, it results in a relatively quick mortality and causes about 1 in every 20,000 deaths of people over 20.

While it is caused by both genetic and environmental factors, 90% of ALS cases occur when the patientâ€™s family has no history of the disease. Of those without family history of ALS, sporadic ALS is the most common. Sporadic ALS means the cause of the disease is unknown. While the cause of the disease is unknown, there are some groups at higher risk than others causing them to have a higher likelihood of developing it. High risk groups include elders, veterans, and smokers.
