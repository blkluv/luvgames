Fundraising is a quintessential part of fighting ALS. Money is integral in subsidizing research efforts, raising awareness, creating resources, and producing treatments. There are many fundraisers and organizations focused on fighting ALS. Some notable fundraisers include:

[Walk to Defeat ALS](https://secure2.convio.net/alsa/site/SPageServer/?pagename=WLK_landing)

This annual fundraiser is run by the ALS Association and held at various locations across the United States. This fundraiser draws people from all backgrounds to honor those who are affected by the disease, show support and solidarity, and remember those who have passed due to ALS. All funds raised during this walk go to developing a cure for ALS.

During ALS Awareness Month in May, advocates, volunteers, donors, and everyone else in the community are asked by the Les Turner ALS Foundation to raise money and awareness for ALS. To do this, you can ask people in your community for donations or start an in-person or virtual donation drive or event to raise money.
