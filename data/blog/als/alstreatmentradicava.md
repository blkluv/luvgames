In terms of treating ALS, there is no cure available for it. However, there are treatments that can be employed to slow its progression. One treatment is Radicava ORS (edaravone) which can be administered orally rather than via IV which was the case for Radicava. Radicava was FDA approved in May of 2017 while Radicava ORS is soon to be approved (retrospective edit: it was approved in May of 2022).

Radicava and Radicava ORS work by relieving oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is when antioxidant levels are low resulting in the breakdown of cell tissue, cells and DNA. Antioxidants are molecules which can donate an electron to free radicals, molecules with an uneven amount of valence (outermost) electrons. If free radicals become too abundant in the body, they can be dangerous and cause harm resulting in illness. Therefore, antioxidants help neutralize them, but if antioxidant levels are too low, they can not neutralize them resulting in free radicals roaming free and causing damage to cells. This oxidative stress is thought to cause the death of motor neurons, so by relieving this stress, Radicava can slow the progression of ALS. In fact, studies have shown that patients who take Radicava experienced a 33% slower decline in their ability to perform everyday functions.

Currently, the use of Radicava (edaravone) is one of only two ALS treatments. Additionally, with Radicava ORS which can be taken orally, this treatment is more accessible than ever before. However, Radicava ORS and Radicava do have some side effects such as bruising, problems walking, and tiredness. Overall, Radicava and Radicava ORS is leading the path in the treatment of ALS and the future of ALS medications.
