Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder is a life-long disorder characterized by one being impulsive, hyperactive, and having difficulty paying attention. The cause of ADHD is unknown; however, it is thought to be genetic in addition to other risk factors such as brain injury or low birth weight. In terms of genetics, it is thought to be caused by a defect in the POXP2 gene which causes low levels of dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, meaning it aids communication in the brain, so low levels of it causes impairment in brain activity. The impairment in activity is responsible for a lot of the main characteristics of someone with ADHD:
-   Impairment in frontal cortex, handles mental tasks→ inattention
    
-   Impairment in limbic system, produces behavioral and emotional responses→ emotional volatility
    
-   Impairment in basal ganglia, controls motor functions→ impulsivity
    
-   Impairment in the reticular activating system, mediates levels of alertness→ hyperactivity
