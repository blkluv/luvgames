# Progressive Web Apps

PWAs, known as Progressive Web Apps, allow you to install a site to your device and use it like a native app, making it much more convenient for you (the user).

Installing DiscussMed as a PWA will allow you to have an app icon on your home screen, which will open discussmed as an app instead of your browser.

# How can I add DiscussMed to my phone?

Below are instructions on how to add DiscussMed to your phone, whether you are on iOS or Android, courtesy of [MobileSyrup](https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/05/24/how-install-progressive-web-app-pwa-android-ios-pc-mac/) for providing the images used in this post.

## iOS

Look for the menu bar on Safari and click on the share icon in the middle. The share icon should be an arrow pointing through a box. Clicking this will open a menu that will show an option called "Add to Home Screen". Click this and press "Add".

## Android

#### Note: On older browser versions you may see a "home" icon with a plus (+) icon inside it. This does the same thing!

Open the menu next to the URL bar. Depending on whether you're using Chrome or Android you'll see a menu option "Install" or "Install App". This is the "Add to Home screen" option displayed for any site that has the necessary features in place.
