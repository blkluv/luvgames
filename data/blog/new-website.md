## Welcome to discussmed!

This is the first post of our blog (hooray! ðŸŽ‰), where our content writers will be delivering blog posts about the disease/disorder that will be focused on in that month. This website was finished on 6/27/2022, but we will be porting over content from our old website <a href="https://medicalseeds.weebly.com">medicalseeds.weebly.com</a>, which we had been using for the past year and a half. The upcoming blog posts will be imported from the old website just so that we aren't missing any content.

Creating this website took over 30 hours to make, so I hope you will have a great user experience. If you aren't sure where to get started, feel free to take a look at <a href="/resources">resources</a>.

In the upcoming weeks, our content writers will be writing plenty of blog content about the disease/disorder of that month, so make sure to check back every week! You can find out what the current topic is as well as the upcoming topics by clicking <a href="/#topics">here</a>.

If you do encounter any bugs/issues or have any questions or concerns, you can contact us with the <a href="/#contact">form here</a>.
